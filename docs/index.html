    <h2>Little about me...</h2>
  </div>
  <p>
    Hi üëã,
    I'm Amitha (she/her), a software engineer by profession, actively pursuing my goal of becoming a therapist
    in my free time. This website is a journal to capture my journey while I explore this new path. I hope someone out
    there finds this helpful.
  </p>
  <h3>My Story</h3>
  <p>
    I did my engineering in computer science and then worked around four and half years as a software engineer in India.
    Those are the best and worst years of my life, I made friends who I can rely on anytime and I also diagnosed with
    depression, anxiety and somatization. That was when I got to know how ignorant and non-inclusive are people around
    me regarding mental health conditions. I did not get much support at work, I was forced to go on an unpaid
    sabbatical. I became Insomnia, my panic attacks increased, and I was always tired that I hated myself. I tried
    a number of psychologists, psychiatrists and neurologists to help myself. I was
    not sure what I was looking for, and I didn't had any hope that I will get better. If not for my supportive friends
    I might not be here writing this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then came covid days when I didn't need to go to office, and It helped me. I was
    able to manage, I accepted how things are, I took my medication on time, I was resting when I can't work, and I was
    finishing my work when I can. People became little more kind and forgiving, or I saw it that way. First, I thought
    maybe just my manager and team that was not
    supportive. I applied internally and changed my job. I worked in that team for few months, I don't want to go into
    details, but It was not good for me. That's when I thought of leaving the country when I did not even imagine that I
    will ever consider.
  </p>
  <p>
    I came to UK to do masters in advanced computer science. After my studies, I got a job as a software engineer. I
    like what I do, the pay is good enough and my health is much better now. But, I don't feel like this is what I
    want to do in my life.
  </p>
  <p>
    I feel I did not need to go through what I went
    through If I was not ignorant about therapy and how to get help when needed. When I read stories about how therapy
    helped people, I want that for everyone who need it. I want to be that friend who can listen when you feel hopeless.
    I want to make people aware how showing a little kindness can make a difference. I want to make a real difference in
    people's lives and help them overcome their struggles. I want something more fulfilling
    and
    meaningful in my career.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, here I am, someone who is completely from different background, who have no knowledge just so much motivation
    and
    passion taking first steps to become therapist.
