<h3>Daily Struggles</h3>
<p>
    I think I spend more time thinking about what to eat than eating. How does everyone sort this out? Living to eat and
    eating to live, doing it forever, still don't know what to do and how to do. If we never had to eat to survive, will
    it be too boring to live?

    If we had a magic box which gives you any food you imagine, will that be a blessing or do you
    feel like you are constrained the by tastes you can imagine?
